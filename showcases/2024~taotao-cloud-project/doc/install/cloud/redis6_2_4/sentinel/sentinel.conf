# Example sentinel.conf

# *** IMPORTANT ***
#
# By default Sentinel will not be reachable from interfaces different than
# localhost, either use the 'bind' directive to bind to a list of network
# interfaces, or disable protected mode with "protected-mode no" by
# adding it to this configuration file.
#
# Before doing that MAKE SURE the instance is protected from the outside
# world via firewalling or other means.
#
#默认情况下，从不同的接口哨兵将不可达
# localhost，或者使用'bind'指令绑定到网络列表
#接口，或使用"protected-mode no" by禁用保护模式
#将它添加到这个配置文件。
#在执行此操作之前，确保该实例受到外部保护
#通过防火墙或其他方式的世界。
#
bind 127.0.0.1 192.168.10.220
protected-mode yes

# port <sentinel-port>
# The port that this sentinel instance will run on
# # 哨兵sentinel实例运行的端口 默认26379,如果是集群的话需要配置端口
port 26379

# By default Redis Sentinel does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis-sentinel.pid when
# daemonized.
#默认情况下，Redis Sentinel不作为守护进程运行。如果你需要的话，使用“yes”。
#注意Redis会在/var/run/redis-sentinel中写入一个pid文件。pid当
#监控
daemonize yes

# When running daemonized, Redis Sentinel writes a pid file in
# /var/run/redis-sentinel.pid by default. You can specify a custom pid file
# location here.
pidfile /opt/taotao-cloud/redis-6.2.4/pid/sentinel.pid

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Sentinel to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
#指定日志文件名。空字符串也可以用于强制
# Sentinel来登录标准输出。注意，如果您使用standard
#但是在后台运行时，日志将被发送到/dev/null
logfile "/opt/taotao-cloud/redis-6.2.4/logs/sentinel.log"

# sentinel announce-ip <ip>
# sentinel announce-port <port>
#
# The above two configuration directives are useful in environments where,
# because of NAT, Sentinel is reachable from outside via a non-local address.
#
# When announce-ip is provided, the Sentinel will claim the specified IP address
# in HELLO messages used to gossip its presence, instead of auto-detecting the
# local address as it usually does.
#
# Similarly when announce-port is provided and is valid and non-zero, Sentinel
# will announce the specified TCP port.
#
# The two options don't need to be used together, if only announce-ip is
# provided, the Sentinel will announce the specified IP and the server port
# as specified by the "port" option. If only announce-port is provided, the
# Sentinel will announce the auto-detected local IP and the specified port.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel announce-ip 1.2.3.4

# dir <working-directory>
# Every long running process should have a well-defined working directory.
# For Redis Sentinel to chdir to /tmp at startup is the simplest thing
# for the process to don't interfere with administrative tasks such as
# unmounting filesystems.
# 哨兵sentinel的工作目录
dir /opt/taotao-cloud/redis-6.2.4/data

# sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>
#
# Tells Sentinel to monitor this master, and to consider it in O_DOWN
# (Objectively Down) state only if at least <quorum> sentinels agree.
#
# Note that whatever is the ODOWN quorum, a Sentinel will require to
# be elected by the majority of the known Sentinels in order to
# start a failover, so no failover can be performed in minority.
#
# Replicas are auto-discovered, so you don't need to specify replicas in
# any way. Sentinel itself will rewrite this configuration file adding
# the replicas using additional configuration options.
# Also note that the configuration file is rewritten when a
# replica is promoted to master.
#
# Note: master name should not include special characters or spaces.
# The valid charset is A-z 0-9 and the three characters ".-_".
# 哨兵sentinel监控的redis主节点的 ip port
# master-name  可以自己命名的主节点名字 只能由字母A-z、数字0-9 、这三个字符".-_"组成。
# quorum 当这些quorum个数sentinel哨兵认为master主节点失联 那么这时 客观上认为主节点失联了
# sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>
#监控的节点名字可以自定义，后边的2代表的：
#如果有俩个哨兵判断这个主节点挂了那这个主节点就挂了，通常设置为哨兵个数一半加一sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2
sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2

# sentinel auth-pass <master-name> <password>
#
# Set the password to use to authenticate with the master and replicas.
# Useful if there is a password set in the Redis instances to monitor.
#
# Note that the master password is also used for replicas, so it is not
# possible to set a different password in masters and replicas instances
# if you want to be able to monitor these instances with Sentinel.
#
# However you can have Redis instances without the authentication enabled
# mixed with Redis instances requiring the authentication (as long as the
# password set is the same for all the instances requiring the password) as
# the AUTH command will have no effect in Redis instances with authentication
# switched off.
#
# Example:
#
# 当在Redis实例中开启了requirepass foobared 授权密码 这样所有连接Redis实例的客户端都要提供密码
# 设置哨兵sentinel 连接主从的密码 注意必须为主从设置一样的验证密码
sentinel auth-pass mymaster taotao-cloud

# sentinel auth-user <master-name> <username>
#
# This is useful in order to authenticate to instances having ACL capabilities,
# that is, running Redis 6.0 or greater. When just auth-pass is provided the
# Sentinel instance will authenticate to Redis using the old "AUTH <pass>"
# method. When also an username is provided, it will use "AUTH <user> <pass>".
# In the Redis servers side, the ACL to provide just minimal access to
# Sentinel instances, should be configured along the following lines:
#
#     user sentinel-user >somepassword +client +subscribe +publish \
#                        +ping +info +multi +slaveof +config +client +exec on

# sentinel down-after-milliseconds <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Number of milliseconds the master (or any attached replica or sentinel) should
# be unreachable (as in, not acceptable reply to PING, continuously, for the
# specified period) in order to consider it in S_DOWN state (Subjectively
# Down).
#
# Default is 30 seconds.
# 指定多少毫秒之后 主节点没有应答哨兵sentinel 此时 哨兵主观上认为主节点下线 默认30秒
# sentinel down-after-milliseconds <master-name> <milliseconds>
sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 30000

# IMPORTANT NOTE: starting with Redis 6.2 ACL capability is supported for
# Sentinel mode, please refer to the Redis website https://redis.io/topics/acl
# for more details.

# Sentinel's ACL users are defined in the following format:
#
#   user <username> ... acl rules ...
#
# For example:
#
#   user worker +@admin +@connection ~* on >ffa9203c493aa99
#
# For more information about ACL configuration please refer to the Redis
# website at https://redis.io/topics/acl and redis server configuration
# template redis.conf.

# ACL LOG
#
# The ACL Log tracks failed commands and authentication events associated
# with ACLs. The ACL Log is useful to troubleshoot failed commands blocked
# by ACLs. The ACL Log is stored in memory. You can reclaim memory with
# ACL LOG RESET. Define the maximum entry length of the ACL Log below.
acllog-max-len 128

# Using an external ACL file
#
# Instead of configuring users here in this file, it is possible to use
# a stand-alone file just listing users. The two methods cannot be mixed:
# if you configure users here and at the same time you activate the external
# ACL file, the server will refuse to start.
#
# The format of the external ACL user file is exactly the same as the
# format that is used inside redis.conf to describe users.
#
# aclfile /etc/redis/sentinel-users.acl

# requirepass <password>
#
# You can configure Sentinel itself to require a password, however when doing
# so Sentinel will try to authenticate with the same password to all the
# other Sentinels. So you need to configure all your Sentinels in a given
# group with the same "requirepass" password. Check the following documentation
# for more info: https://redis.io/topics/sentinel
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: starting with Redis 6.2 "requirepass" is a compatibility
# layer on top of the ACL system. The option effect will be just setting
# the password for the default user. Clients will still authenticate using
# AUTH <password> as usually, or more explicitly with AUTH default <password>
# if they follow the new protocol: both will work.
#
# New config files are advised to use separate authentication control for
# incoming connections (via ACL), and for outgoing connections (via
# sentinel-user and sentinel-pass)
#
# The requirepass is not compatable with aclfile option and the ACL LOAD
# command, these will cause requirepass to be ignored.

# sentinel sentinel-user <username>
#
# You can configure Sentinel to authenticate with other Sentinels with specific
# user name.

# sentinel sentinel-pass <password>
#
# The password for Sentinel to authenticate with other Sentinels. If sentinel-user
# is not configured, Sentinel will use 'default' user with sentinel-pass to authenticate.

# sentinel parallel-syncs <master-name> <numreplicas>
#
# How many replicas we can reconfigure to point to the new replica simultaneously
# during the failover. Use a low number if you use the replicas to serve query
# to avoid that all the replicas will be unreachable at about the same
# time while performing the synchronization with the master.
# 这个配置项指定了在发生failover主备切换时最多可以有多少个slave同时对新的master进行 同步，
#这个数字越小，完成failover所需的时间就越长，
#但是如果这个数字越大，就意味着越 多的slave因为replication而不可用。
#可以通过将这个值设为 1 来保证每次只有一个slave 处于不能处理命令请求的状态。
sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1

# sentinel failover-timeout <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Specifies the failover timeout in milliseconds. It is used in many ways:
#
# - The time needed to re-start a failover after a previous failover was
#   already tried against the same master by a given Sentinel, is two
#   times the failover timeout.
#
# - The time needed for a replica replicating to a wrong master according
#   to a Sentinel current configuration, to be forced to replicate
#   with the right master, is exactly the failover timeout (counting since
#   the moment a Sentinel detected the misconfiguration).
#
# - The time needed to cancel a failover that is already in progress but
#   did not produced any configuration change (SLAVEOF NO ONE yet not
#   acknowledged by the promoted replica).
#
# - The maximum time a failover in progress waits for all the replicas to be
#   reconfigured as replicas of the new master. However even after this time
#   the replicas will be reconfigured by the Sentinels anyway, but not with
#   the exact parallel-syncs progression as specified.
#
# Default is 3 minutes.
# 故障转移的超时时间 failover-timeout 可以用在以下这些方面：
#1. 同一个sentinel对同一个master两次failover之间的间隔时间。
#2. 当一个slave从一个错误的master那里同步数据开始计算时间。直到slave被纠正为向正确的master那里同步数据时。
#3.当想要取消一个正在进行的failover所需要的时间。
#4.当进行failover时，配置所有slaves指向新的master所需的最大时间。不过，即使过了这个超时，slaves依然会被正确配置为指向master，但是就不按parallel-syncs所配置的规则来了
# 默认三分钟
sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000

# SCRIPTS EXECUTION
#
# sentinel notification-script and sentinel reconfig-script are used in order
# to configure scripts that are called to notify the system administrator
# or to reconfigure clients after a failover. The scripts are executed
# with the following rules for error handling:
#
# If script exits with "1" the execution is retried later (up to a maximum
# number of times currently set to 10).
#
# If script exits with "2" (or an higher value) the script execution is
# not retried.
#
# If script terminates because it receives a signal the behavior is the same
# as exit code 1.
#
# A script has a maximum running time of 60 seconds. After this limit is
# reached the script is terminated with a SIGKILL and the execution retried.
# NOTIFICATION SCRIPT
#
# sentinel notification-script <master-name> <script-path>
#
# Call the specified notification script for any sentinel event that is
# generated in the WARNING level (for instance -sdown, -odown, and so forth).
# This script should notify the system administrator via email, SMS, or any
# other messaging system, that there is something wrong with the monitored
# Redis systems.
#
# The script is called with just two arguments: the first is the event type
# and the second the event description.
#
# The script must exist and be executable in order for sentinel to start if
# this option is provided.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel notification-script mymaster /var/redis/notify.sh
#配置当某一事件发生时所需要执行的脚本，可以通过脚本来通知管理员，例如当系统运行不正常时发邮件通知相关人员。
#对于脚本的运行结果有以下规则：
#若脚本执行后返回1，那么该脚本稍后将会被再次执行，重复次数目前默认为10
#若脚本执行后返回2，或者比2更高的一个返回值，脚本将不会重复执行。
#如果脚本在执行过程中由于收到系统中断信号被终止了，则同返回值为1时的行为相同。
#一个脚本的最大执行时间为60s，如果超过这个时间，脚本将会被一个SIGKILL信号终止，之后重新执行。

#通知型脚本:当sentinel有任何警告级别的事件发生时（比如说redis实例的主观失效和客观失效等等），将会去调用这个脚本，
#这时这个脚本应该通过邮件，SMS等方式去通知系统管理员关于系统不正常运行的信息。调用该脚本时，将传给脚本两个参数，
#一个是事件的类型，
#一个是事件的描述。
#如果sentinel.conf配置文件中配置了这个脚本路径，那么必须保证这个脚本存在于这个路径，并且是可执行的，否则sentinel无法正常启动成功。
#通知脚本
# sentinel notification-script <master-name> <script-path>
# sentinel notification-script mymaster /var/redis/notify.sh


# CLIENTS RECONFIGURATION SCRIPT
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script <master-name> <script-path>
#
# When the master changed because of a failover a script can be called in
# order to perform application-specific tasks to notify the clients that the
# configuration has changed and the master is at a different address.
#
# The following arguments are passed to the script:
#
# <master-name> <role> <state> <from-ip> <from-port> <to-ip> <to-port>
#
# <state> is currently always "failover"
# <role> is either "leader" or "observer"
#
# The arguments from-ip, from-port, to-ip, to-port are used to communicate
# the old address of the master and the new address of the elected replica
# (now a master).
#
# This script should be resistant to multiple invocations.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script mymaster /var/redis/reconfig.sh
# 客户端重新配置主节点参数脚本
# 当一个master由于failover而发生改变时，这个脚本将会被调用，通知相关的客户端关于master地址已经发生改变的信息。
# 以下参数将会在调用脚本时传给脚本:
# <master-name> <role> <state> <from-ip> <from-port> <to-ip> <to-port>
# 目前<state>总是“failover”,
# <role>是“leader”或者“observer”中的一个。
# 参数 from-ip, from-port, to-ip, to-port是用来和旧的master和新的master(即旧的slave)通信的
# 这个脚本应该是通用的，能被多次调用，不是针对性的。
# sentinel client-reconfig-script <master-name> <script-path>
# sentinel cli

# SECURITY
#
# By default SENTINEL SET will not be able to change the notification-script
# and client-reconfig-script at runtime. This avoids a trivial security issue
# where clients can set the script to anything and trigger a failover in order
# to get the program executed.
# SECURITY
# 默认情况下，哨兵集不能更改通知脚本

#和client-reconfig-script在运行时。这避免了一个微不足道的安全问题

#客户端可以将脚本设置为任意值，并按顺序触发故障转移

#执行程序。
sentinel deny-scripts-reconfig yes

# REDIS COMMANDS RENAMING
#
# Sometimes the Redis server has certain commands, that are needed for Sentinel
# to work correctly, renamed to unguessable strings. This is often the case
# of CONFIG and SLAVEOF in the context of providers that provide Redis as
# a service, and don't want the customers to reconfigure the instances outside
# of the administration console.
#
# In such case it is possible to tell Sentinel to use different command names
# instead of the normal ones. For example if the master "mymaster", and the
# associated replicas, have "CONFIG" all renamed to "GUESSME", I could use:
#
# SENTINEL rename-command mymaster CONFIG GUESSME
#
# After such configuration is set, every time Sentinel would use CONFIG it will
# use GUESSME instead. Note that there is no actual need to respect the command
# case, so writing "config guessme" is the same in the example above.
#
# SENTINEL SET can also be used in order to perform this configuration at runtime.
#
# In order to set a command back to its original name (undo the renaming), it
# is possible to just rename a command to itself:
#
# SENTINEL rename-command mymaster CONFIG CONFIG

# HOSTNAMES SUPPORT
#
# Normally Sentinel uses only IP addresses and requires SENTINEL MONITOR
# to specify an IP address. Also, it requires the Redis replica-announce-ip
# keyword to specify only IP addresses.
#
# You may enable hostnames support by enabling resolve-hostnames. Note
# that you must make sure your DNS is configured properly and that DNS
# resolution does not introduce very long delays.
#
SENTINEL resolve-hostnames no

# When resolve-hostnames is enabled, Sentinel still uses IP addresses
# when exposing instances to users, configuration files, etc. If you want
# to retain the hostnames when announced, enable announce-hostnames below.
#
SENTINEL announce-hostnames no
