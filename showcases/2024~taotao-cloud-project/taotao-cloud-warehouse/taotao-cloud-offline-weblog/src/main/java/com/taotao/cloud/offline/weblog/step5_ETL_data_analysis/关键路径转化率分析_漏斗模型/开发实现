分步骤开发：

1.查询每一个步骤的总访问人数
create table dw_oute_numbs as
select 'step1' as step,count(distinct remote_addr)  as numbs from ods_click_pageviews where request like '/item%'
union
select 'step2' as step,count(distinct remote_addr) as numbs from ods_click_pageviews where request like '/category%'
union
select 'step3' as step,count(distinct remote_addr) as numbs from ods_click_pageviews where request like '/order%'
union
select 'step4' as step,count(distinct remote_addr)  as numbs from ods_click_pageviews where request like '/index%';


2.查询每一步骤相对于路径起点人数的比例
select rn.step as rnstep,rn.numbs as rnnumbs,rr.step as rrstep,rr.numbs as rrnumbs  from route_num rn
inner join
route_num rr


select tmp.rnstep,tmp.rnnumbs/tmp.rrnumbs as ratio
from
(
select rn.step as rnstep,rn.numbs as rnnumbs,rr.step as rrstep,rr.numbs as rrnumbs  from dw_oute_numbs rn
inner join
dw_oute_numbs rr) tmp
where tmp.rrstep='step1';


3.查询每一步骤相对于上一步骤的漏出率
select tmp.rrstep as rrstep,tmp.rrnumbs/tmp.rnnumbs as ration
from
(
select rn.step as rnstep,rn.numbs as rnnumbs,rr.step as rrstep,rr.numbs as rrnumbs  from route_num rn
inner join
route_num rr) tmp
where cast(substr(tmp.rnstep,5,1) as int)=cast(substr(tmp.rrstep,5,1) as int)-1


4.汇总以上两种指标
select abs.step,abs.numbs,abs.ratio as abs_ratio,rel.ratio as rel_ratio
from
(
select tmp.rnstep as step,tmp.rnnumbs as numbs,tmp.rnnumbs/tmp.rrnumbs as ratio
from
(
select rn.step as rnstep,rn.numbs as rnnumbs,rr.step as rrstep,rr.numbs as rrnumbs  from route_num rn
inner join
route_num rr) tmp
where tmp.rrstep='step1'
) abs
left outer join
(
select tmp.rrstep as step,tmp.rrnumbs/tmp.rnnumbs as ratio
from
(
select rn.step as rnstep,rn.numbs as rnnumbs,rr.step as rrstep,rr.numbs as rrnumbs  from route_num rn
inner join
route_num rr) tmp
where cast(substr(tmp.rnstep,5,1) as int)=cast(substr(tmp.rrstep,5,1) as int)-1
) rel
on abs.step=rel.step
